    Subsystem Decomposition of Themis

The **Authentication** subsystem helps the user authenticate using the **Login** subsystem. Once a user successfully logs in,
the **Course** subsystem takes over, responsible for displaying courses where the user is as a tutor. Additionally, this
subsystem manages the retrieval and presentation of exercises and exams associated with these courses. When the system
needs to present more detail about a particular exam or an exercise, the **Exercise** and **Exam** subsystems come into play.
The **Exam** subsystem primarily focuses on presenting the exercises within an exam context and leverages the **Exercise**
subsystem when the user selects a particular exercise. When the user initiates an assessment on a submission, the
**Assessment** subsystem.
