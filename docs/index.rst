Themis: Artemis Tutor App for iPad
======================================================

Themis is an innovative iPad app providing a comprehensive and optimized way for tutors to assess student submissions
on the go. As a complementary extension to the `Artemis <https://docs.artemis.cit.tum.de/>`_ platform,
an open-source learning management system used at universities, Themis allows tutors to effortlessly
inspect students' submissions and provide feedback.

Designed as a native iPad application, Themis optimizes viewing and assessing exercises on a mobile
device. Its' intuitive interface and user-friendly assessment editor enable tutors to give general as well as
referenced feedback for programming, text, modeling, and file upload exercises. Leveraging the iPad's unique features
allows a more convenient and streamlined feedback process using Themis. By supporting the Apple Pencil, tutors can
highlight specific segments and provide comments using the Scribble feature.

Through the connection to the Artemis server, tutors can log in and select the corresponding course as usual to
seamlessly continue the assessment on the go. To enhance the feedback process even further, Themis assists tutors by
providing feedback suggestions. By analyzing submissions and comparing past feedback from previous assessments, feedback
suggestions fitting to current submissions are proposed. The suggestions are displayed for tutors to review and modify
as needed, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment process.
