File upload exercises do **not** support referenced feedback.

The following **file extensions** are supported by Themis and can be viewed without leaving 
the app:

- pdf
- jpeg
- png
- doc
- docx
- xlsx
- txt
- csv

If a submission contains an unsupported file, you can download the file and export it 
to another app to view:

.. figure:: ./images/file-upload-unsupported.png

	:align: center
