Assess Exam Exercises
---------------------

Themis supports the assessment of exam exercises as well. To assess an exam exercise, 
navigate to the relevant exam and select the exercise that you want to assess. 

If the second correction round is enabled and all submissions for the first round are assessed, 
the **Start Assessment** button changes into **Start Assessment (Round 2)**. In addition, 
the **Open Submissions (Correction Round 2)** and **Finished Submissions (Correction Round 2)** 
sections appear.
