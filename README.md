# Themis: iPad app for tutors using Artemis

Themis transforms the way you evaluate university students' code with our innovative iPad app designed specifically fortutors using Artemis. Using the powerful Apple Pencil and ML technology, grading has never been easier.
It uses the LMS [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis), as well as the FSS (Feedback Suggestion Service) [Themis-ML](https://github.com/ls1intum/Themis-ML). 
Themis is currently tested at the Technical University of Munich. In the future, it may also be used by all the other universities using [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis).
