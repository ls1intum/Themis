# Themis: iPad app for tutors using Artemis

Themis is an innovative iPad app providing a comprehensive and optimized way for tutors to assess submitted programming exercises on the go. As a complementary extension to the [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis) platform, an open-source learning management system used at universities, Themis allows tutors to effortlessly inspect students’ code and provide feedback on submissions.

Designed as a native iPad application, Themis optimizes viewing and assessing programming exercises on a mobile device. Its intuitive interface and user-friendly assessment editor enable tutors to give both general as well as code-specific inline feedback. Leveraging the iPad’s unique features allows a more convenient and streamlined feedback process using Themis. By supporting the Apple Pencil, tutors can highlight specific code segments and provide comments using the Scribble feature.

Through the connection to the Artemis server, tutors can log in and select the corresponding course as usual, to seamlessly continue the assessment on the go. To enhance the feedback process even further, Themis assists tutors while providing more suitable and effective feedback. For this, [Themis-ML](https://github.com/ls1intum/Themis-ML) is incorporated, a system for automated feedback suggestions of programming exercises. By analyzing the code and comparing past feedback from previous assessments, fitting feedback to current submissions is proposed. This smart feedback is displayed for tutors to review and modify as needed, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment process.
